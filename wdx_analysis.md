2. HEALTH :-Being healthy should be part of your overall lifestyle. Living a healthy lifestyle can help prevent chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. Feeling good about      yourself and taking care of your health are important for your self-esteem and self-image. Maintain a healthy lifestyle by doing what is right for your body.Sudden infant    death syndrome (SIDS), also known as cot death or crib death, is the sudden unexplained death of a child of less than one year of age. Diagnosis requires that the death      remain unexplained even after a thorough autopsy and detailed death scene investigation,which is very uncertain to hear,So I would like to investigate more on infant          death.

3. Number of infant deaths,female

- Infant death syndrome is a very bad phase of a particular child,who dies in the dark and who doesn't explore the world and does not feel the touch of dear ones.Just for the   informatory purpose I would like to investigate and depict the infant deaths happening per year
